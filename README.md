# Automating online classes!

<h2><b><i>About:</i></b></h2>

  Using web-automation you can prevent being late by just running a python file.

  We use pyautogui and sys to control our mouse movements. <br>
  We use time module to take breaks while our program is running.<br>
  We use webbrowser to control website tasks like opening a webpage.
