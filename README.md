# Automating online classes!

<h2><b><i>About:</i></b></h2>
<p>
  I created this to make the proccess of joining online classes easier. Many students find it difficult to join classes on time while being at home and in their comfort zone.
  Using web-automation you can prevent being late by just running a python file. 
</p>

<h2><b><i>Modules used:</i></b></h2>

<ul>
  <li>pyautogui, sys</li>
  <li>time</li>
  <li>webbrowser</li>
</ul>

<p>
  
  We use pyautogui and sys to control our mouse movements. <br>
  We use time module to take breaks while our program is running.<br>
  We use webbrowser to control website tasks like opening a webpage.
  
</p>

<h2><b><i>To use this source follow the following steps:</i> </b></h2>

<b> 1) </b> I have written a function to track your mouse movements. The values that we get are the co-ordinates of the mouse. Lets say you open a webpage...and there is a button that you need to click. Run the mouse tracking function, hover over that button and get the co-ordinates of your mouse at that point. By doing that we now have the location of the specific button on your screen. You can substitue those values in the program where it says: pyautogui.moveTo(x,y). Replace 'x' and 'y' with your values.

</p>

<b> 2) </b> Once you have the co-ordinates of the buttons that are going to be used. You can substitute those values in the program, you are free to add as many mouse movements as you want.
